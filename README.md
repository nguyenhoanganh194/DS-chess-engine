# DS-chess-engine
A distributed system project that is done alone by me. Grade: 5/5. The project contains 3 different nodes that run in Docker Container on the server side (load balancer, game server, AI server). The project aims to create a chess engine that can do match-making, validate game state (Cheat proof), and scale vertically and horizontally.
